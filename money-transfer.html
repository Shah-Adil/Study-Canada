          <h2>Easy Money Transfer for International Students</h2>
          <p>
            Money transfers are a necessity for most international students. But there
            are so many options, it can be confusing. If you don’t want to worry about
            direct bank transfers with high exchange rates, or if you don’t want to pay
            by credit card, we have the solution.
          </p>
          <h3>Why do I need it?</h3>
          <p>Money transfers are a fast and convenient way to securely pay for tuition,
            living expenses, and accommodation. Plus all the fun stuff, like travel and
            entertainment!

            For your study expenses, funds from your home country can be paid in local
            currency and transferred in your destination country currency to each
            recipient, such as your university or accommodation provider.

            For some countries, your living expenses can be transferred directly into your
            bank account – in your local currency. You can withdraw your money at ATMs
            when you reach.
          </p>

          <h3>Can a family member, friend, or third party pay on my behalf?</h3>
          <p>
            Definitely!
            Simply include the personal information of the family member or friend who will be making your payment in
            the
            “Payer Information” section during the booking
            process. If you are paying through a third party, you can include the information of the person who
            instructs
            them to transfer the funds.

            The sender or the payer is the person who holds the account where the money will be sent from. If a family
            member, friend, or third party is paying for you, the
            name you include in the request must be the one stated on their bank records or card.

            A mismatch between the sender name provided to us and the account holder name stated in the bank records may
            cause delays in the processing of your payment.

            If you are paying by loan from your bank in India, you can either provide the loan signer/borrower details
            or
            include your loan provider details on the sender
            information; both are equally acceptable.

            Currently, we can only offer domestic payment options for certain institutions.

            If you are trying to make a domestic payment (same country), and your country is not listed on our website,
            it means that we do not offer domestic payment

            be located in the country in which the sender is

          <br />

        </p>

        <h4>Whose information should I supply for "Payer Information"?</h4>
        <p>
          When making a payment request with Flywire, you need to enter the
          payer name and address. If you are paying through a third party, you
          can enter the name and address of the person who instructs them to
          transfer the funds. This information is mandatory for compliance
          purposes.
          <br />
          You will need to provide us with the street address that matches the
          payer’s bank records. The address must be located in the country in
          which the sender is paying.
          <br />
          Please note that we do not accept post office boxes as a valid
          address.
        </p>
        <h4>What exchange rate will be applied to my payment?</h4>
        <p>
          Flywire and its locally licensed partners offer competitive exchange
          rates that are often lower than bank’s rates.
          <br />
          It's important to compare your personal bank’s rate to Flywire’s
          rate, rather than to those found online. The exchange rates posted
          on many websites are "mid-market rates,” which are not always
          available to the average consumer.
          <br />
          Because exchange rates are in constant flux, please make sure to
          review and compare rates to each other within a time-frame of one to
          two hours, ideally.
        </p>

        <h4>What is included in the amount I have to pay?</h4>
        <p>
          Regardless of your currency selection, we will always show you the
          total amount due before you finalise your payment request. Flywire
          will not impose any additional fees on top of this amount due
          <br />
          If you transfer funds in your local currency, the amount due will
          include all foreign exchange fees and any additional fees charged by
          our payment partners (if applicable).
          <br />
          If you transfer funds in a non-local currency, we may charge a
          convenience fee which will be included in the total amount due, and
          the exact amount of the fee will be displayed under it. This
          convenience fee covers expenses Flywire incurs from processing
          non-local currencies.
        </p>
        <h4>When will my institution receive my payment?</h4>
        <p>
          The time it takes for your payment to reach your institution can
          vary depending on the payment method.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Bank Transfer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From the moment Flywire receives the funds from your bank, it
          usually takes 2 to 3 business days to process and deliver the
          payment to your institution. After Flywire receives your payment, it
          will automatically be guaranteed to your institution
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Card or other online payment methods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have chosen to pay by card or other online payment methods,
          your payment is automatically guaranteed to your institution.
          Typically, funds are delivered within 2 to 3 business days after the
          payment was made.
        </p>

        <h4>Do you accept credit cards and debit cards?</h4>
        <p>
          At this time, we accept debit and credit card payments for certain
          institutions.
          <br />
          If, when you are making your payment request, Visa, and/or
          MasterCard are listed as payment options, that means the credit card
          option is available for your payment.
          <br />
          For certain institutions and countries, we can accept additional
          card brands. Those cards’ logos will be displayed once you select
          the country when making your payment request.
          <br />
          If a card’s logo is not displayed, that means we are unable to
          accept it.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is the amount different between payment method options?</h4>

        <p>
          If you check our rates for the bank transfer, you will notice that
          the price is lower. Because bank transfers do not involve card
          payment processors, we can provide better pricing. Select this
          option if you are looking to make a payment at the lowest cost
          available.
          <br />
          Credit card payments, on the other hand, are instantaneous and offer
          many advantages in terms of convenience and speed.
          <br />
          If you need to make a time-sensitive payment, then the card option
          is a great choice. We advise payers to use credit cards denominated
          in their local currency to avoid charges resulting from the currency
          conversions. If a dual or different currency credit card is used,
          the payer’s bank may charge a currency conversion fee to send the
          payment to Flywire.
        </p>

          payment with Flywire?
